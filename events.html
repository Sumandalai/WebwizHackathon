                <p data-aos="fade-up">Cryptocurrency trading or crypto trading involves buying and selling cryptocurrencies to earn profit. We speculate mainly on the price movement of cryptocurrency. As of recently, this field is pretty hyped up, and people are driven towards it. When we talk about the competition, the RSTO game token comes into account. It is the driving force of the competitions. Top rankers will get the reward in terms of RSTO, while low rankers will face some loss. Thus it builds up a reward system where you play more to earn more.</p>

                <p data-aos="fade-up">Webwiz, in collaboration with Postman, had organized a super informative, hands-on session on API, called APIs 101, to help students and techno-worms learn API essentials. API or Application Programming Interface is a framework that encapsulates more complex and more used codes and gives a more straightforward syntax for its utilization, allowing faster communication for servers. This event, held towards the end of March, was significant for Webwiz as a club as it got to work together with Postman, which is currently the world's leading collaboration platform for API development.</p>
